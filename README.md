Configuration
The model's configuration is defined using the MiniMaxConfig dataclass. Hereâ€™s an example configuration:

python
Copy
Edit
config = MiniMaxConfig(
    n_layer=12,
    n_head=8,
    n_embd=512,
    vocab_size=30000,
    block_size=1024,
    dropout=0.1,
    use_checkpoint=True,
    use_moe=True,
    num_experts=4,
    moe_top_k=2
)
Modify the parameters to suit your use case, such as:

Increasing n_layer for deeper models.
Adjusting moe_top_k and num_experts for MoE-based tasks.
Toggling use_flash_attn for attention optimization.
Usage
Training
python

input_ids = torch.randint(0, config.vocab_size, (batch_size, sequence_length))
targets = torch.randint(0, config.vocab_size, (batch_size, sequence_length))

logits, loss = model(input_ids, targets=targets)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
Inference
python
Copy
Edit
model.eval()
input_ids = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3]])  # Example input
